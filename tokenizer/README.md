# aux.tokenizer
Copyright Â© 1997 Bart Massey

This set of classes, which desperately needs some Javadoc,
is an alternative to all the standard Java parsing stuff
that breaks its input into simple "tokens" and returns a
token at a time. See the file `Tokenizer.java` for the
interface.

To build this, you need to be sitting in `../..` and compile
`aux/tokenizer/*.java`. Thank you stupid Java path-based
package names.
