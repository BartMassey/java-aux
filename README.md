# java-aux
Copyright Â© 1996 Bart Massey

This is a collection of very old library code I wrote in
Java. Much of it is now superseded by standardly-available
Java functionality, but I have Java code lying around that
relies on it, so I continue to maintain it.

With the introduction of `java.lang.Comparable` to core in
Oracle Java 1.8, it appears that this code no longer works
there. C'est la vie. It seems to compile fine under OpenJDK
1.7, which is what I am using anyway.

There are a million deprecation warnings in this code, mostly
because it is AWT-based and has never been converted to Swing.

To build this code, it is sufficient to say "javac *.java".
See the couple of subdirectories here for notes and
instructions on compiling them.

Javadoc is desperately needed here.
